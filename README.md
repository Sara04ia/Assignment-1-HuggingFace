# Assignment 1 HuggingFace

#Assignment 1: Submit a write-up on the following:
Explain and give an example for

# **Hugging face agents :**

**Answer:** Hugging face agents is virual assestant that has a tools help in building a model and provide a workflows platform also it contain alot of a trained model
for Example
- text generation
- text classification


# **Hugging face pipeline for text generation**
**Answer:**  is an API to loading the model and tokenizer of that model
for Example 
- model (bloom)


# **HF inference endpoints**
**Answer :** Hugging Face Inference Endpoints allow developers to deploy and serve machine learning models as scalable APIs

# ** Give feedback on the image generation and explore different models available on the Hugging Face website**
**Answer:** Hugging Face offers a variety of models and tools that makes it easy to experiment with these models through APIs which is great for both developers and non-technical users.


#Assignment 2: Using OpenAI's CLIP Model for Image Captioning and Building an Image Search Engine

#Objective

##In this assignment, you will use OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) model to:
- Generate captions for 15 different images.
- Build a search engine for these images using a larger dataset of images.


##Part 1: Generate Captions for Images
gen image then generate a text as the image for the dog and text
##Part 2: Build an Image Search Engine


##Submission
Submit the following as a **Streamlit** app:

- Your Python code for generating captions and building the search engine.
- A report describing your approach, challenges faced, and how you overcame them.
- Screenshots of the interface and results.

Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness and efficiency of the code.
- Clarity and completeness of the report.
- Usability and functionality of the search engine interface.
